"""The guardrail layer.

This module is the product. The hackathon premise is that AI is already being
used on X-ray and CT without agreed safety standards; this file encodes those
standards as executable rules rather than a PDF nobody reads.

Five rules, applied to every AI interaction:

  1. Scope    - the assistant teaches, it does not diagnose real patients.
  2. Identify - anything that looks like patient identifiers is refused.
  3. Caveat   - every output carries a disclaimer, always, with no opt-out.
  4. Confidence - low-confidence model output is flagged, never shown bare.
  5. Trace   - every interaction is written to the audit log.
