# Logging
#
# uvicorn configures only its own `uvicorn*` loggers. It never calls
# basicConfig and never touches the root logger, so an application logger like
# `medly.gemini` inherits root's WARNING with no handler attached — and every
# logger.info() in this codebase is discarded before it reaches stdout.
#
# Configuring just the `medly` namespace turns our own logs on without making
# SQLAlchemy and friends verbose. propagate=False keeps a single copy of each
# line even if something else configures root later.
