        "body_md": '''A concussion \u2014 a *mild traumatic brain injury* (mTBI) \u2014 typically resolves within a few weeks. For a significant number of people, the physical, cognitive and psychological effects persist for months or even years.

When neurological symptoms fail to clear within the expected timeframe, they can severely disrupt someone's ability to work, study and maintain relationships. This article outlines how post-concussion syndrome develops, when to seek specialist advice, and the therapeutic pathways available.

## What are the symptoms after mild TBI?

Symptoms after mild TBI, sometimes termed *post-concussion syndrome*, are highly varied and typically span physical, cognitive and emotional categories. They can appear immediately after the head injury or emerge days later, and often fluctuate in intensity depending on physical exertion or mental focus.

- **Physical:** persistent headaches (frequently resembling migraine or tension headache), dizziness, nausea, light and sound sensitivity, and fatigue.
- **Cognitive:** difficulty concentrating, brain fog, short-term memory deficits, slowed information processing, reduced ability to multitask.
- **Emotional and behavioural:** irritability, anxiety, low mood, emotional sensitivity.
- **Sleep:** insomnia, fragmented sleep, or an excessive need for sleep during the day.

## Why do symptoms persist?

Studies suggest that as many as half of people may not be fully recovered six months after a so-called mild TBI. The underlying mechanisms are complex and multi-faceted, bringing together the direct physical effects of injury \u2014 disruption to brain tissue \u2014 and difficulties with brain function that do not directly reflect damage, such as psychological problems. The brain's ability to process information efficiently can become impaired, producing a wide array of symptoms that fluctuate with daily activity levels.

Research shows that the severity of the initial head injury does not necessarily predict who will develop chronic symptoms. A history of previous concussions, pre-existing migraine, or pre-injury psychiatric problems can each increase vulnerability to prolonged recovery.

## When should someone seek a specialist neurological assessment?

Follow the standard advice after a possible TBI first, so that no emergency problem is missed \u2014 see the [NHS guidance on head injury and concussion](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/head-injury-and-concussion/).

Where problems are ongoing, a head-injury specialist neurologist can help. A specialist examination reviews the injury in detail and evaluates a range of neurological systems: cognition, psychiatric symptoms, sleep, and vestibular function (balance and spatial orientation). Because standard CT scans often appear completely normal following a mild head injury, it is the detailed clinical history and specialised symptom assessment that establish an accurate management plan.

## Management and rehabilitation pathways

Modern management of persistent post-concussive symptoms has shifted away from prolonged dark-room rest towards targeted, active rehabilitation, tailored to each patient's symptom profile.

- **Sub-symptom threshold exercise** \u2014 carefully controlled, gradual cardiovascular training that restores normal autonomic function and improves blood flow to the brain without triggering symptoms.
- **Vestibular and ocular therapy** \u2014 specialised physical therapy that retrains the integration of visual and balance signals, directly reducing dizziness and nausea.
- **Cognitive rehabilitation** \u2014 structured strategies and pacing techniques, guided by neuropsychologists, for memory deficits, attention difficulties and mental fatigue.
- **Pharmacological support** \u2014 targeted medication for post-traumatic headache, sleep disturbance or associated mood change.

## What is the long-term outlook?

The outlook is highly encouraging where care is structured and specialist-guided. The brain possesses a remarkable capacity for neuroplasticity \u2014 the ability to adapt, reorganise and forge new neural pathways over time. Working with a specialist neurologist, people can successfully manage their symptoms, regain control over daily life, and return to their personal and professional goals.

        "body_md": '''Autoimmune encephalitis is a group of conditions in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy brain cells, causing inflammation of the brain. It can affect people of all ages, though certain types are more common in young adults and children. Because the brain governs behaviour, memory and bodily function, that inflammation produces a wide range of symptoms which often appear suddenly and progress rapidly.

## How it presents

Common early signs include confusion, memory loss, and changes in personality or behaviour. Individuals may become anxious or paranoid, or experience hallucinations.

As the condition advances, more severe neurological symptoms can develop: seizures, difficulty speaking, abnormal movements, or loss of consciousness. In some cases patients require intensive care because of complications affecting breathing or heart function.

## The antibodies involved

Autoimmune encephalitis is often associated with antibodies that target specific proteins in the brain. One well-known form involves antibodies against NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, which disrupt normal brain signalling and produce the characteristic symptoms.

The condition can sometimes be linked to tumours \u2014 particularly ovarian teratomas \u2014 though many cases occur with no identifiable trigger.

## Why diagnosis is difficult

Diagnosis is challenging because the symptoms may resemble psychiatric disorders or viral infections. Clinicians typically rely on a combination of clinical evaluation, brain imaging, spinal fluid analysis and blood tests to detect specific antibodies.

Early diagnosis matters: prompt treatment significantly improves outcomes.

## Treatment

Treatment usually involves immunotherapy to reduce the immune system's attack on the brain. This may include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or plasma exchange. Where a tumour is implicated, surgical removal is often necessary.

With timely treatment many patients recover well, though rehabilitation may be needed to address lingering cognitive or physical difficulties. Ongoing research continues to improve understanding and management of this complex condition.

            "Cancer therapy has become dramatically more targeted, and patients are living "
            "longer. The systems for recording what those therapies cost patients day to day "
            "have not kept pace."
        ),
        "body_md": '''> **About this piece.** This is a summary of the *Nature Medicine* editorial "Oncology must confront hidden side effects" (doi:[10.1038/s41591-026-04554-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-026-04554-9)), included here for teaching. Read the original for the full argument and its citations.

Recent breakthroughs in cancer therapy \u2014 immunotherapies, antibody\u2013drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies \u2014 have transformed oncology care. Treatment is more precisely targeted to a patient's tumour, and overall survival is lengthening. But people who survive cancer can face lifelong challenges from treatment-induced toxicities with both short- and long-term effects, and the editorial's argument is that the tooling for recording and managing those effects has not innovated at the same pace as the drugs.

## What current reporting misses

Trial reporting leans on CTCAE grading, which was not designed to capture functional and psychological disruption. Impaired daily functioning and emotional wellbeing therefore sit outside the framework \u2014 they are, in the editorial's word, *hidden* from prescribing clinicians in the first years after a therapy rolls out.

Full quality-of-life data, which would cover daily functioning and emotional wellbeing, frequently goes undisclosed because follow-up is short. The consequence is practical: patients may be less accepting of new agents when the expected toxicities cannot be described to them, because those toxicities are unknown, underappreciated, or their severity is underestimated.

## Why the gaps persist

Two structural problems compound the measurement gap.

1. **Exposure takes time.** Some toxicities \u2014 certain skin toxicities among them \u2014 only come to light once a broader patient population has been exposed to the drug. Early trial populations are too small and too selected to surface them.
2. **Disciplines are siloed.** Historical siloing limits knowledge transfer about how to detect, monitor and manage therapy-induced toxicity. Cytokine release syndrome in CAR T cell therapy and immune-related adverse events in checkpoint inhibition are the examples given \u2014 syndromes that demand expertise which may sit in a different department entirely.

As therapies are implemented across more cancer types, rare treatment-induced syndromes become more likely to appear, and coordinated research into their mechanisms is what would let clinicians mitigate the risk and develop better-targeted treatments.

## Why this matters for training

The editorial is a reminder that a treatment's record is incomplete until someone has asked the patient how they are actually functioning \u2014 and that a grading scale which does not ask cannot report the answer. For anyone learning to appraise oncology evidence, the useful habit is to check what a trial measured before accepting what it concluded about tolerability.
